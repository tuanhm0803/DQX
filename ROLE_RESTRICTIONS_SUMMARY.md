# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented role-based access restrictions to block users with the "inputter" role from having publish/populate privileges in DQ scripts page and accessing the source data management page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Role Permission Functions Added (`app/role_permissions.py`)
- **`can_publish_populate()`**: Restricts publish/populate operations to admin and creator roles only
- **`can_access_source_management()`**: Restricts source data management access to admin and creator roles only
- **`can_delete_scripts()`**: Restricts SQL script deletion to admin and creator roles only
- **`can_delete_schedules()`**: Restricts scheduled job deletion to admin and creator roles only

### 2. SQL Scripts Route Restrictions (`app/routes/sql_scripts.py`)
Applied role-based dependencies to:
- `GET /editor/{script_id}/populate` (page route) - `can_publish_populate`
- `GET /editor/{script_id}/publish` (page route) - `can_publish_populate`  
- `POST /{script_id}/populate_table` (API endpoint) - `can_publish_populate`
- `POST /{script_id}/publish` (API endpoint) - `can_publish_populate`
- `GET /editor/delete/{script_id}` (page route) - `can_delete_scripts`
- `DELETE /{script_id}` (API endpoint) - `can_delete_scripts`

### 3. Scheduler Route Restrictions (`app/routes/scheduler.py`)
Applied `can_delete_schedules` dependency to:
- `GET /schedules/delete/{schedule_id}` (page route)
- `DELETE /api/schedules/{schedule_id}` (API endpoint)

### 4. Source Data Management Route Restrictions (`app/routes/source_data_management.py`)
Applied `can_access_source_management` dependency to ALL routes:
- Main page: `GET /source_data_management`
- Table operations: create, insert, truncate, drop, view
- API endpoints: database connections, schemas, tables, testing

### 5. Frontend Template Updates

#### SQL Editor Template (`app/templates/sql_editor.html`)
- **Populate/Publish buttons**: Only visible to admin and creator roles
- **Delete button**: Only visible to admin and creator roles
- **Access restriction message**: Shows warning for inputter users about missing permissions for delete, populate, and publish
- **Data pipeline instructions**: Only shown to users with appropriate permissions

#### Index Page (`app/templates/index.html`) 
- **Source Data Management card**: Only visible to admin and creator roles
- Hidden completely for inputter users

#### Scheduler Template (`app/templates/scheduler.html`)
- **Auto-publish checkbox**: Only available to admin and creator roles
- **Delete buttons**: Only visible to admin and creator roles for scheduled jobs
- **Warning message**: Shows restriction notice for inputter users about auto-publish and delete restrictions

| View Reports/Stats | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Security Implementation

### Backend Protection
- **HTTP 403 Forbidden**: API endpoints return proper error codes for unauthorized access
- **Dependency injection**: FastAPI dependencies enforce permissions at the route level
- **Consistent error messages**: Clear permission denied messages for all restricted operations

### Frontend Protection  
- **Progressive disclosure**: UI elements hidden based on user role
- **Graceful degradation**: Clear messaging when features are restricted
- **Visual indicators**: Warning messages explain permission requirements

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with inputter user**:
   - Verify no populate/publish/delete buttons appear in SQL editor
   - Confirm source data management card is hidden on homepage
   - Check direct URL access returns 403 errors
   - Validate auto-publish option is disabled in scheduler
   - Test that script deletion URLs return 403 Forbidden
   - Verify schedule delete buttons are hidden and URLs return 403

2. **Test with creator user**:
   - Verify all restricted features are accessible
   - Confirm UI elements are visible and functional

3. **Test with admin user**:
   - Verify full access to all features
   - Confirm no restrictions apply

## Error Handling
- **API calls**: Return HTTP 403 with descriptive error messages
- **Direct URL access**: Redirect unauthorized users appropriately  
- **Form submissions**: Block restricted operations with clear feedback
- **JavaScript calls**: Handle 403 responses gracefully in frontend

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding logging for permission-denied attempts
- Implement audit trail for sensitive operations
- Add role-based filtering for data visibility
- Consider granular permissions beyond role-based access
