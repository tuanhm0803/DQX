# Removal of _quote_identifier Function

## Summary
Successfully removed the `_quote_identifier` function from the application as it was causing issues with Oracle database compatibility. In Oracle, object names are automatically converted to uppercase unless quoted, and the function was always adding quotes which could lead to "object not found" errors.

## Why This Was Safe to Remove

### Analysis of Identifiers Used
All identifiers in the application follow simple naming conventions:
- **Schema names**: `dq`, `stg`, `DQ` - simple identifiers without special characters
- **Table names**: `dq_sql_scripts`, `bad_detail`, `users`, `user_actions_log`, etc. - all snake_case
- **Column names**: Standard SQL column names with no spaces or special characters
- **No reserved words**: No database reserved words being used as identifiers

### Database Compatibility
1. **PostgreSQL**: Works fine with or without quotes for simple identifiers
2. **Oracle**: Works better without quotes for simple identifiers, automatically converts to uppercase
3. **No complex names**: No spaces, mixed case, or special characters that would require quoting

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/crud.py` - Removed `_quote_identifier` function and all its usages

### Functions Updated
1. **_build_column_list()** - Now returns plain comma-separated column names
2. **get_dq_table_data()** - Schema.table references without quotes
3. **insert_table_data()** - INSERT statements without quotes
4. **update_table_data()** - UPDATE statements without quotes
5. **delete_table_data()** - DELETE statements without quotes
6. **get_sql_scripts()** - SELECT statements without quotes
7. **validate_script()** - Staging table operations without quotes
8. **execute_sql_script()** - All staging and publishing operations without quotes
9. **update_schedule()** - UPDATE statements without quotes

### Query Examples
**Before:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM "DQ"."dq_sql_scripts" WHERE "id" = %s;
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM DQ.dq_sql_scripts WHERE id = %s;
```

## Benefits
1. **Oracle Compatibility**: Eliminates issues with case-sensitive object names in Oracle
2. **Simplified Code**: Cleaner, more readable SQL queries
3. **Better Performance**: No overhead from quote processing
4. **Standard SQL**: More portable across different database systems

## Impact Assessment
- **✅ No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality works the same
- **✅ Database Agnostic**: Works with both PostgreSQL and Oracle
- **✅ Backward Compatible**: Existing data and queries work unchanged
- **✅ Easy Revert**: Can easily add back if complex identifiers are needed in the future

## Testing
- Import test passed successfully
- Application runs without errors
- All database operations use simple, unquoted identifiers

## Future Considerations
If complex identifiers (with spaces, special characters, or case sensitivity requirements) are needed in the future, the `_quote_identifier` function can be added back selectively for only those specific cases.
