# Logging Implementation - Issue Resolution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Unauthorized Error on Actions Log Page**
**Problem**: Getting unauthorized error when accessing `/user-actions-log` even as admin
**Root Cause**: Used wrong authentication dependency (`get_current_user` from auth.py instead of role-based permissions)
**Solution**: 
- Created `can_view_logs` permission function in `role_permissions.py`
- Updated user actions log routes to use proper role-based authentication
- Now only admin and editor users can access the log page

### 2. ✅ **CRUD Functions Not Working**
**Problem**: User actions logging and retrieval functions returned empty results
**Root Cause**: JSON parsing error in `get_user_actions_log` function - trying to `json.loads()` a dict that was already deserialized by PostgreSQL JSONB
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the JSONB handling by removing unnecessary `json.loads()` call
- Details field is now handled correctly as it's already a dict from PostgreSQL
- Added proper error handling and debugging

### 3. ✅ **Database Transaction Issues**
**Problem**: Middleware not properly committing database transactions
**Solution**: 
- Added proper transaction management with `db.commit()` and `db.rollback()`
- Added error handling to prevent middleware failures from breaking requests

## Verification Tests Completed

### ✅ **Database Tables Created**
- `dq.user_actions_log` table is working
- `dq.schedule_run_log` table is working
- All indexes created successfully

### ✅ **CRUD Functions Working**
- `log_user_action()` - Successfully creates log entries
- `get_user_actions_log()` - Now retrieves logs correctly with filtering
- `create_schedule_run_log()` - Creates schedule run entries
- `get_schedule_run_logs()` - Retrieves schedule logs

### ✅ **Server Running**
- FastAPI server running on http://localhost:8000
- All routes properly mounted
- Authentication system working
- Middleware properly configured

## How to Test the Features

### 1. **Login as Admin/Editor**
```
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/login
2. Login with admin or editor credentials
3. You'll see "Actions Log" in the navigation menu
```

### 2. **Access User Actions Log**
```
1. After login, click "Actions Log" in navigation
2. Or go directly to http://localhost:8000/user-actions-log
3. You should see the log page with filters and any existing logs
```

### 3. **View Schedule Run Logs**
```
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/schedules/
2. Scroll down to see "Recent Schedule Runs" section
3. Should load automatically via JavaScript
```

### 4. **Test Automatic Logging**
```
1. Perform any actions (login, create scripts, etc.)
2. Check the user actions log page to see logged activities
3. The middleware will automatically capture most user actions
```

## Features Now Working

### ✅ **User Actions Log Page**
- Advanced filtering by username, action, resource type, date range
- Pagination with configurable page sizes
- Details modal for viewing action specifics
- Role-based access (admin/editor only)

### ✅ **Schedule Run Logs**
- Real-time display on scheduler page
- Status tracking with color-coded badges
- Error message display for failed runs
- Duration and rows affected tracking

### ✅ **Automatic Action Logging**
- Middleware captures user actions automatically
- Logs include user info, IP address, user agent
- Transaction safety with proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Login and Test**: Use admin credentials to login and test the features
2. **Verify Logging**: Perform some actions and check if they appear in logs
3. **Test Filtering**: Use the filter options on the user actions log page
4. **Schedule Testing**: Create/run scheduled jobs to test schedule run logging

All major issues have been resolved and the logging system should now be fully functional!
